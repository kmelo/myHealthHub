# myHealthHub
This is my final project for Harvard's CS50 class on the Edx platform.

Since 2013, I've been my father's caregiver at home, taking care of him while he waited for a heart transplant. Thankfully, he had the transplant and is now making a solid recovery. However, over the course of this year and after attending every single doctor appointment and my Dad has to keep up with many appointments with many doctors, and his medication list is constantly changing, and he needs to monitor his weight gain as well, and this was very cubersome for my Dad so I decided to create MyHealthHub to help him with that problem.

MyHealthHub is a prototype website application whose purpose is to:

-track a patient's list of current medications
-graph a patient's weight by month in order help with weight control or restricted diets
-keep a table of all a patient's appointments with doctors
-store a patient's list of medical doctors who are rendering care for easy access
